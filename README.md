A simple Weather App for Android.

This app needs an API key from http://openweathermap.org/api to function.

Create a class named KeyKeeper.java in the directory: me/sivze/feelslike

The class looks as follows:

public final class KeyKeeper { public static final String openWeatherMapAPIKey = YOUR_API_KEY; }
